# ZeroUI
School project. <br>
App was made with kotlin. <br>
App for testing different Zero UI elements. 

# Starting The Project
Use Android Studio and android phone to use the project. <br>
It is recommended to use android phone because emulator doesn't support all the sensors needed for the app.
Also newer wersions of the vision-task("com.google.mediapipe:tasks-vision:0.10.0") will cause errors ad it trys to use one thread for more than one action. 
Getting the recognizer to work in combosable was no possible as of this time 

# Views and what they mean
Motion Sensor view is where the app uses sensors to detect phones movement. <br>
In Gaze view the app tracks users eye movement. <br>
Gesture view uses camera to see users hand(s) to recognize different hand signs and displayes what the hand sign is in our app.

# What can you do in the app?
User can use voice to control where to go in Front view. <br>
User can check Motion Sensor view. There is a step counter and rotation vector. <br>
User can check Gaze view. There ...  <br>
User can check Gesture view. There through camera user can make different hand signs and the app recognizes them. <br>
There are currently seven recognized hand signs implemented. <br>
